# NFL Data Application

A comprehensive application for analyzing, visualizing, and managing NFL data with intelligent insights and reporting capabilities.

## How you should behave

- I am learning and building this project. Always:
  - Explain things in simple, clear language.
  - Narrate what you're doing when you edit files or run commands.
  - Prefer boring, stable technologies and clear structure over cleverness.
  - Ask clarifying questions if requirements are ambiguous.

- Workflow for any non-trivial task:
  1. **Explore**: relevant files, existing code, and available tools. Do NOT write code yet.
  2. **Plan**: create or update a PLAN.md with a Markdown checklist and wait for my approval.
  3. **Implement**: in small, logical steps with clear commit messages. Use tests where practical.
  4. **Verify**: run tests, linters, and the dev server. Fix all issues until they pass.
  5. **Summarize**: at the bottom of PLAN.md, describe what changed and how to run things.

- Use extended thinking when I say things like "think hard about this" or "ultrathink".

- When uncertain about project direction, ask me first rather than guessing.

## Coding style

- Keep functions small and well-named. Aim for single responsibility.
- Prefer clear comments explaining *why*, not just *what*.
- Keep dependencies minimal; explain any new ones you add.
- Use type hints where applicable.
- Follow PEP 8 for Python, or relevant style guides for other languages.

## Testing & running

- Always keep `README.md` up to date with:
  - **Install commands** – how to set up the environment
  - **Run commands** – how to start the application
  - **Test commands** – how to run the test suite
  - **Project structure** – brief overview of key directories

- When adding a feature:
  - Add or update tests to cover the new functionality.
  - Ensure existing tests still pass.
  - Document any new configuration or environment variables needed.

## Current status

- [x] Project structure initialized
- [ ] Core functionality implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] README documentation complete
- [ ] Deployment ready

## Next steps

1. Create README.md with project overview and setup instructions
2. Create PLAN.md with initial development roadmap
3. Set up project directory structure (src/, tests/, data/, docs/)
4. Define core data models and API structure
5. Implement initial features
